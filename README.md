## Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). According to the [React Documentation](https://reactjs.org/docs/create-a-new-react-app.html), create-react-app is one of the official ways to create a single-page application in React.

### Prerequisites

To have a local copy of this tutorial up and running on your local machine, you will first need to install the following software / libraries / plug-ins

- [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/) - Download and install Node. This will also include NPM (Node Package Manager).
- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) - Download and install VS Code or any Editor/IDE(Integrated Development Environment) of your choice. - Optional

See the following section for detailed step-by-step instructions on how to install this software / libraries / plug-ins

## Installing Frontend

Navigate to folder named Frontend.
A step by step series of instructions that tell you how to get a development environment running. Let's use Node + NPM for this assignment.

- First of all head to the official [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/) website to download and install Node, which also includes NPM.
- Select either of the "Recommended For Most Users" button or "Latest Features" button and download the latest version for your Operating System.
- After you download and install Node, open command prompt/terminal on your desktop and run the following commands to check if everything works:
  - node -v
  - npm -v
- To run the application, change to the directory where the app was installed using "cd <folder_name>" on command prompt/terminal.
- Run "yarn install" to install all the dependencies used by the app.
- Finally, run "yarn dev" to see the app live on the localhost.

## Installing Backend

Navigate to folder named Backend.
A step by step series of instructions that tell you how to get a development environment running. Let's use Node + NPM for this assignment.
